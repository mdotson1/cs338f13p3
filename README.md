Prerequisites:  
1. Maven build tool installed.  
2. Java JDK 1.6 or higher installed.  
3. git version control installed.  
4. mysql installed locally. At least version 6.0. Could possibly work on lesser
	versions, but has not been tested.  
5. mysql administration account that can create databases and tables. If your
	administration account is not username "root" and password "secret",
	you will need to change the global variable USERNAME and PASSWORD in the
	file com/cs388/f13p2/database/DBHelper.java.  

Steps to run project tests:  
1. git clone https://github.com/mdotson1/cs338f13p2.git  
2. navigate to cs388f13p1/UniversityRegistrationSystem/  
3. mvn clean install  
4. java -cp target/com.cs388f13p2-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar com.cs388f13p2.view.Registration  

Output will be some tests for the functionality of the application based on the
Project Case Study (SSD_Course__Project_Case_Study.pdf).
